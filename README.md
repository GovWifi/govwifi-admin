# Govwifi Admin Application

This is the admin platform, a website where organisations can create and manage their GovWifi installation within their organisation.

## Overview

The application allows users to perform the following tasks:

- Create an admin account.
- Invite team members to their account.
- View instructions on how to setup and configure GovWifi on their local network.
- Add IP addresses of their access points to the GovWifi system.
- View logs of authentication requests to GovWifi by IP and username.
- Make support ticket requests.

The application also includes a "Super Admin" login feature that allows a GDS administrator to:

- View all organisations signed up to GovWifi
- See specific information on each of these organisations
- Add custom organisation names to the allowed register

The application uses a few third party services, including:

- [GOV.UK Registers][registers] as a resource for Government organisations to select their names from a predetermined list of registered organisations as they create their accounts.

- [GOV.UK Notify][notify] to handle sending out situational emails to users.

- [GOV.UK Zendesk][zendesk] to handle forms submitted by the user within the app.

The application also provides the following data for the RADIUS configuration via an S3 bucket:

- IP addresses.
- RADIUS secret keys
