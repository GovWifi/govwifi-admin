          Owing to the new GDPR regulations - we are issuing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to all organisations that want to use GovWifi.
          This doesn't imply any contractual obligation on either side.
          Instead, it sets out precisely what we - GDS - do and what we leave to the participating department/organisation.
          The most important elements relate to data, namely what we do with data and what we leave to you.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The document requires a signature in two place: sections 4.2 and 16.2.
          There's also a provision for you to add your escalation route in section 4.9.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The MOU has already been signed by GDS's behalf.
          Please download the MOU and sign it.
          Upload the signed copy in the section below.
          Your organisation will then have access to GovWifi.
