<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Allowed Organisation Names</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
  For an organisation to sign up to GovWifi, their organisation's name needs to be on the 'register', which is a known list
  of accepted public sector organisation names. If the organisation is not on the list, then the name can be added. Once an
  organisation's name is whitelisted, it will appear in the drop down list during the signup process.
</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Allowed End User Email Addresses</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Anyone with an email ending in ".gov.uk" can request a GovWifi username and password. For any organisations with emails that
  don't end in ".gov.uk" their email domain needs to be whitelisted first. Once an organisation's email domain is whitelisted,
  all end users of the organisation will be able to signup for GovWifi.
